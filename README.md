# Zori's Dungeon Crawler
made using [Terminal.GUI](https://github.com/gui-cs/Terminal.Gui)

This is going to be a typical dungeon crawl rogue-like inspired by [Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup](https://crawl.develz.org/), but with extensive moddability.
For now, the plan is to just put out a playable release.

## Future plans
- Better, diverse map generation
- Try out a more detailed character/action system with focus on stamina and limb damage (something like Kenshi)
- Either a better creature parser or some kind of extensive mod support to allow for user-created actions instead of baked-in functions

## Progress so far
- Decent looking dungeons generated with cellular automata and some rooms thrown in at random positions.
- Movement (including between floors) and proper dungeon render with super simple LOS
- Lots of foundation bits for UI, creatures, etc.

## To-Do:
- map gen:
  - place creatures and items around
- creatures:
  - work out damage and armor calculation with inventory and equipment 
    - Actually, work out the whole RPG system
  - probably should refactor the Creature code
  - figure out the `.json` parser, at least for stats
- items:
  - make some basic items to carry around and equip
  - make equipment actually contribute to calculations
  - figure out how the active abilities from items will work
- UI:
  - add test items to inventory
  - add tile/entity inspection
  - implement better FOV
- AI: 
  - create some sort of Action class/interface that both NPCs and Player will use
  - hook up basic functions like attacking and moving around
